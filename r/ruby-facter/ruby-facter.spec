%description
A cross-platform Ruby library for retrieving facts from
operating systems. Supports multiple resolution mechanisms, any
of which can be restricted to working only on certain operating
systems or environments. Facter is especially useful for
retrieving things like operating system names, IP addresses, MAC
addresses, and SSH keys.

It is easy to extend Facter to include your own custom facts or
to include additional mechanisms for retrieving facts.
