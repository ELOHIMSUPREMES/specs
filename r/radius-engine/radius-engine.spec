Patch1:		radius-engine-0.7-shared-libs.patch
# Latest autoconf enables "extra-portability" along with "Wall", which causes
# warnings (treated as errors because of Wall) to be thrown. We just need to 
# pass "-Wno-extra-portability" to fix this.

# I could not figure out a way to generate a patch to enable shared libraries 
# that worked right. All my attempts resulted in an environment where make, 
# when invoked, would re-run aclocal and automake. :P
# So, I'm just running autoreconf in the spec file. :P :P
BuildRequires:	autoconf libtool
