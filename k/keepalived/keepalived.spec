%description
The main goal of the keepalived project is to add a strong & robust keepalive
facility to the Linux Virtual Server project. This project is written in C with
multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. Keepalived implements a framework based on three
family checks : Layer3, Layer4 & Layer5/7. This framework gives the daemon the
ability of checking a LVS server pool states. When one of the server of the LVS
server pool is down, keepalived informs the linux kernel via a setsockopt call
to remove this server entrie from the LVS topology. In addition keepalived implements
an independent VRRPv2 stack to handle director failover. So in short keepalived is a
userspace daemon for LVS cluster nodes healthchecks and LVS directors failover.
