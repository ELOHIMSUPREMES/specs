%description
GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any OpenGL
application. The main difference between GL2PS and other similar
libraries is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling
intersecting and stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects.
GL2PS provides advanced smooth shading and text rendering, culling of
invisible primitives, mixed vector/bitmap output, and much more.
