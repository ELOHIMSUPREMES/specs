%description
The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform open-source C/C++
extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining 
which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL core and extension
functionality is exposed in a single header file. GLEW has been tested on a variety of 
operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris.
