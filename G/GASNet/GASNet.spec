%description
GASNet is a language-independent, low-level networking layer that
provides network-independent, high-performance communication primitives
tailored for implementing parallel global address space SPMD languages
such as UPC, Titanium, and Co-Array Fortran. The interface is primarily
intended as a compilation target and for use by runtime library writers
(as opposed to end users), and the primary goals are high performance,
interface portability, and expressiveness. GASNet stands for
"Global-Address Space Networking".

The design of GASNet is partitioned into two layers to maximize porting
ease without sacrificing performance: the lower level is a narrow but
very general interface called the GASNet core API - the design is based
heavily on Active Messages, and is implemented directly on top of each
individual network architecture. The upper level is a wider and more
expressive interface called the GASNet extended API, which provides
high-level operations such as remote memory access and various
collective operations.
