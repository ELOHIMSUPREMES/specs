%description
Bocca is a command line tool for creating and maintaining CCA components and
applications. Bocca makes creating ports and components as easy giving them a
name. Bocca also provides a scaffolding for building, testing and maintaining
components. While Bocca provides a "best practices" source tree, the resulting
infrastructure uses only standard development tools (e.g. autotools) and is in
no way dependent on Bocca itself. Bocca generates the source tree only, and lets
the user decide when and if they wish to abandon the Bocca way of doing things.
Bocca has enjoyed early success and is now the basis of the CCA tutorial.
