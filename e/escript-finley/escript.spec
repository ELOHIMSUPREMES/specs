%description
Escript is a python-based programming tool for mathematical modelling
based on non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations. It
has been designed to give modelers an easy-to-use environment for
develop and run complex and coupled models without accessing the
underlying data structures directly. This approach leads to highly
portable codes allowing the user to run a simulation on desktop
computers as well as highly parallel supercomputer with no changes to
the program. Escript is suitable for rapid prototyping (e.g for a
student project or thesis) as well as for large software projects. It
has successfully being used in a broad spectrum of applications
including Earth mantel convection, earthquakes, porous media flow,
reactive transport, plate subduction, and tsunamis.
