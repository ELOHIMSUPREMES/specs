%description
Erubis is a fast, secure, and very extensible implementation of eRuby.
It has the following features:
* Very fast, almost three times faster than ERB and about ten percent
  faster than eruby (implemented in C).  * File caching of converted
  Ruby script support.
* Auto escaping (sanitizing) support, it means that '<%= %>' can be
  escaped in default. It is desirable for web application.  * Spaces
  around '<% %>' are trimmed automatically only when '<%' is at the
  beginning of line and '%>' is at the end of line.
* Embedded pattern changeable (default '<% %>'), for example '[% %]' or
  '<? ?>' are available.  * Enable to handle Processing Instructions
  (PI) as embedded pattern (ex. '<?rb ... ?>'). This is desirable for
  XML/HTML than '<% .. %>' because the latter breaks HTML design but
  the former doesn't.
* Multi-language support (Ruby/PHP/C/Java/Scheme/Perl/Javascript).
* Context object available and easy to combine eRuby template with YAML
  datafile (see the below example).  * Print statement available.
* Easy to expand and customize in subclass
* Ruby on Rails support.
* Mod_ruby support.
