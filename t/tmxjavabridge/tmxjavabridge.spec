%description
TMXResourceBundle is an Open Source extension of Java 
ResourceBundle class to read text resources directly from a
TMX file.
TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) is the vendor-neutral open
XML standard for the exchange of Translation Memory (TM) 
data created by Computer Aided Translation (CAT) and 
localization tools. The purpose of TMX is to allow easier 
exchange of translation memory data between tools and/or 
translation vendors with little or no loss of critical data
during the process. In existence since 1998, TMX is a 
certifiable standard format. TMX is developed and maintained
by OSCAR (Open Standards for Container/Content Allowing 
Re-use), a LISA (Localization Industry Standards Association)
Special Interest Group.
One of the main concerns of internationalization consists of
separating the main source code from the texts, the labels, 
the messages and all the other objects related to the specific 
language in use. This facilitates the translation process as 
such as all the resources related to the local language 
context are well identified and separated.
Since version JDK 1.1, Java provides great support for 
internationalization (i18n) by offering several instruments 
and tools, for example the support to Unicode 2.0, the 
multilingual environments and the object localization, just 
to mention a few.
However, all these instruments may not be sufficient when we 
target a global market in which the costs to translate and 
update the texts (including labels, messages, menu elements 
and so on) can easily become quite high.
This is the context where the TMX standard comes to help by 
applying to the translation and management process of these 
texts the concepts of reuse, increase of consistency, and the 
shortening of the production cycle. All this with the added 
bonus of cutting the development costs.
