%description
Libnet is an API to help with the construction and handling of network
packets.  It provides a portable framework for low-level network
packet writing and handling (use Libnet in conjunction with libpcap and
you can write some really cool stuff).  Libnet includes packet creation
at the IP layer and at the link layer as well as a host of supplementary
and complementary functionality. Libnet is avery handy with which to
write network tools and network test code.  See the manpage and sample
test code for more detailed information.
