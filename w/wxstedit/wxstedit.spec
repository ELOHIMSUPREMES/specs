%description
wxStEdit is a library and sample program for the wxWidgets's wxStyledTextCtrl
wrapper around the Scintilla text editor widget. It provides a number of
convenience functions and added capabilities, including the necessary
prefs/styles/language management, menu creation and updating, a splitter,
notebook, and frame component. Additionally it provides a find/replace, editor
settings, and property dialogs. It is designed to be easily integrated into a
larger program and while it tries to manage as much as possible, it's fairly
extensible as well. Individual features and &quot;helper&quot; functionality
can be turned off or overridden if desired. The bottom line, this editor
builds upon the wxStyledTextCtrl by adding all the necessary code to ease the
burden of providing a full featured editor or a set of identically styled
editors in a notebook or frame.
