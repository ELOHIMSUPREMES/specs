%description
This package adds two new ZCML directives to automatically detect ZCML
files to include: "includeDependencies" and "includePlugins".

When you want to include a Zope-based package in your application, you
have to repeat yourself in two places: you have to add the package
itself (in a setup.py, buildout, etc) and you also have to include its
ZCML with an <include> directive or a package-includes slug. Because you
have to repeat yourself, you can easily make an error where you add a
new package but forget to include its ZCML.

z3c.autoinclude lets you circumvent this error-prone process with
automatic detection and inclusion of ZCML files.
