%description
LZF is an extremely fast (not that much slower than a pure memcpy)
compression algorithm. It is ideal for applications where you want to save
*some* space but not at the cost of speed. It is ideal for repetitive
data as well. The module is self-contained and very small (no large
library to be pulled in). It is also free, so there should be no problems
incorporating this module into commercial programs.

I have no idea wether any patents in any countries apply to this
algorithm, but at the moment it is believed that it is free from any
patents.
