%description
`repoze.postoffice` provides a centralized depot for collecting incoming
email for consumption by multiple applications.  Incoming mail is sorted
into queues according to rules with the expectation that each
application will then consume its own queue.  Each queue is a
first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue, so messages are processed in the order
received.

ZODB is used for storage and is also used to provide the client
interface.  `repoze.postoffice` clients create a ZODB connection and
manipulate models.  This makes consuming the message queue in the
context of a transaction, relatively simple.
