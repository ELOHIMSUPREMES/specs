%description
Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It
monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been
executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been
executed but was not.

Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of
tests. It can show which parts of your product code are being exercised
by tests, and which are not.
