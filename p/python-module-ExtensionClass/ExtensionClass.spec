ExtensionClass:
This package provides a metaclass that allows classes implemented in
extension modules to be subclassed in Python. Unless you need
ExtensionClasses for legacy applications (e.g. Zope 2), you probably
want to use Python's new-style classes (available since Python 2.2).

ComputedAttribute:
This package provides a way to attach attributes to an ExtensionClass or
instance that are computed by calling a callable. This works very much
like property known from new-style classes, except that a
ComputedAttribute can also be attached to an instance and that it
honours ExtensionClass semantics (which is useful for retaining
Acquisition wrappers, for example).

MethodObject:
This package lets you attach additional "methods" to ExtensionClasses.
These "methods" are actually implemented by subclassing the
MethodObject.Method class and implementing the __call__ method there.
Instances of those classes will be bound to the instances they're
attached to and will receive that instance object as a first parameter
(after self).
