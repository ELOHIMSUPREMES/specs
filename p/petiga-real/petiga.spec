%description
This software framework implements a NURBS-based Galerkin finite element
method (FEM), popularly known as isogeometric analysis (IGA). It is
heavily based on PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
Computation. PETSc is a collection of algorithms and data structures for
the solution of scientific problems, particularly those modeled by
partial differential equations (PDEs). PETSc is written to be applicable
to a range of problem sizes, including large-scale simulations where
high performance parallel is a must. PetIGA can be thought of as an
extension of PETSc, which adds the NURBS discretization capability and
the integration of forms. The PetIGA framework is intended for
researchers in the numeric solution of PDEs who have applications which
require extensive computational resources.
