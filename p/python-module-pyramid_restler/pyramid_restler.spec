%description
pyramid_restler is a somewhat-opinionated toolkit for building RESTful
Web services and applications on top of the Pyramid framework.
Essentially, it routes HTTP requests to Pyramid views. These views
interact with model entities via a uniform context interface, and then
respond with appropriate status codes and entity representations.
