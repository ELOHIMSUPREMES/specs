%description
Support the efficient creation of hookable objects, which are callable
objects that are meant to be replaced by other callables, at least
optionally.

The idea is you create a function that does some default thing and make
it hookable. Later, someone can modify what it does by calling its
sethook method and changing its implementation.  All users of the
function, including those that imported it, will see the change.
