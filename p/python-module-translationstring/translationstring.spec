%description
A library used by various Repoze packages for internationalization
(i18n) duties related to translation.

This package provides a translation string class, a translation string
factory class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a utility
that helps Chameleon templates use translation facilities of this
package. It does not depend on Babel, but its translation and
pluralization services are meant to work best when provided with an
instance of the babel.support.Translations class.
