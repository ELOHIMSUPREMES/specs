%description
django_factory is a generic implementation of `Creation Methods` for
Django models.

Using django_factory in your tests means that each test can create
instances of the models, but only has to specify the model attributes
that are germane to that particular test.

Using creation methods usually leads to tests that are easier to read,
and makes it easier to avoid convoluted test setup methods that are
shared, as the pre-conditions for each test are easier to establish.
