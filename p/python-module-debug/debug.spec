%description
Start fancy debugger in a single statement.

People debug with print. It's great in simple cases. Another debugging
tool, pdb, is less popular as it requires more effort: one has to do a
Google search, skim through documentation, type some long "trace...
sth", and all of this only to get some unfriendly two-color shell that
doesn't even seem to understand how tab key should work.

This project FTFY: you import debug and you find yourself in a debugger
with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and readable dir()
alternative. From there you can pretend you're just using interactive
console -- you don't have to know any pdb commands, just remember that
"c" closes debugger and goes back to your program.

(What really happens is that we simply start ipdb and import see for
you.)
