%description
This product implements OpenID authentication support for Zope via a
Pluggable Authentication Service plugin.

Using this package everyone with an OpenID authentity will be able to
login on your Zope site. OpenID accounts are not given any extra roles
beyond the standard Authenticated role. This allows you to make a
distinction between people that have explicitly signed up to your site
and people who are unknown but have succesfully verified their identity.
