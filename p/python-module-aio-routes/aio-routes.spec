%description
Aio-routes is a URL routing library for web applications. It doesn't
support typical pattern-based or regular-expression bases routing. But
rather it traverses objects while resolving an url. See examples below,
for more info

Aioroutes works not only for HTTP but for any kind of RPC, for example
for method invocation over WebSockets. HTTP support is built-in, for
other kinds of things small pieces of glue code is needed.
