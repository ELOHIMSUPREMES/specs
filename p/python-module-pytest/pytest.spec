%description
py.test is a command line tool to collect, run and report about
automated tests. It runs well on Linux, Windows and OSX and on Python
2.4 through to 3.1 versions. It is used in many projects, ranging from
running 10 thousands of tests to a few inlined tests on a command line
script. As of version 1.2 you can also generate a
no-dependency py.test-equivalent standalone script that you can
distribute along with your application.
