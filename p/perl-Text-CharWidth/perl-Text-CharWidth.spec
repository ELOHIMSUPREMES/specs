%description
This is a module to provide equivalent feature as wcwidth(3) and
wcswidth(3).  This also provides mblen(3) equivalent subroutine.

mbwidth() and mbswidth() are provided subroutines corresponding
wcwidth(3) and wcswidth(3) in C language.  The prefix "mb" expresses
that they handles "multibyte character" in C meaning, i.e., character
encoding specified by LC_CTYPE locale.

These subroutines are used to get the width of characters on terminal.
Though most characters have width of 1, there are exceptions.
Fullwidth characters are characters with width of 2.  Most of east
Asian characters such as Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, Han Ideogram
are fullwidth.  Combining characters are characters with width of 0.
Unicode has many combining characters like diacritical marks.  There
are languages which need combining characters such as Thai and
Vietnamese.
