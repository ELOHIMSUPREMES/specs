%description
This library is a trivial implementation of an interface in Python,
with the following aspects / features:

* It fails at import time, not at construction, so you know
  immediately when you have a problem.
* It's quite simple (very few LOC) and lenient where it counts
* It exclusively uses decorators, so...
* It does not require inheritance (reducing 'forced' subclassing)
* It does not enforce any typing checks
* It is intended to 'enhance' duck typing by avoiding common
  pitfalls (forgot to implement something on your fake duck class,
  overwrote something fundamental, etc.)
