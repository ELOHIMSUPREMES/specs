%description
Data structures could be described as trees. Some are by nature treeish,
like XML documents, LDAP directories or filesystem directory trees,
while others can be treated that way.

Furthermore, python has elegant ways for customizing all sorts of
datamodel related APIs. The dictionary container type fits almost
completely the purpose of representing a node of a tree. The same API is
also described in zope.interface.common.mapping.IFullMapping.
Additionaly a node must provide hierarchy information. In this case the
contract of zope.location.interfaces.ILocation is used.
