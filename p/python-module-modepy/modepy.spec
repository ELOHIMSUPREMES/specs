%description
modepy helps you create well-behaved high-order discretizations on
simplices (i.e. triangles and tetrahedra). These are a key building
block for high-order unstructured discretizations, as often used in a
finite element context.

The basic objects that modepy manipulates are functions on a simplex.
For example, it supplies an orthonormal basis on triangles (shown here)
and tetrahedra.
