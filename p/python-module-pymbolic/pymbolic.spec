%description
Pymbolic is a small expression tree and symbolic manipulation library.
Two things set it apart from other libraries of its kind:

* Users can easily write their own symbolic operations, simply by
  deriving from the builtin visitor classes.
* Users can easily add their own symbolic entities to do calculations
  with.

Pymbolic currently understands regular arithmetic expressions,
derivatives, sparse polynomials, fractions, term substitution,
expansion. It automatically performs constant folding, and it can
compile its expressions into Python bytecode for fast(er) execution.
