%description
"Text::Quoted" examines the structure of some text which may contain
multiple different levels of quoting, and turns the text into a nested
data structure.

The structure is an array reference containing hash references for each
paragraph belonging to the same author. Each level of quoting recursively
adds another list reference.

This also tells you about what's in the hash references: "raw" is the
paragraph of text as it appeared in the original input; "text" is what
it looked like when we stripped off the quotation characters, and "quoter"
is the quotation string.
