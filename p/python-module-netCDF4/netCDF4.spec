%description
netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the
library and is implemented on top of HDF5. This module can read and
write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3 format, and
can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The API modelled
after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users of that
module.

Most new features of netCDF 4 are implemented, such as multiple
unlimited dimensions, groups and zlib data compression. All the new
numeric data types (such as 64 bit and unsigned integer types) are
implemented. Compound and variable length (vlen) data types are
supported, but the enum and opaque data types are not. Mixtures of
compound and vlen data types (compound types containing vlens, and vlens
containing compound types) are not supported.
