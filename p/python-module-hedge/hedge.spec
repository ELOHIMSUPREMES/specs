%description
hedge is an unstructured, high-order, parallel Discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) code that I am developing as part my PhD project. hedge's design is
focused on two things: being fast and easy to use. While the need for
speed dictates implementation in a low level language, these same
low-level languages become quite cumbersome at a higher level of
abstraction. This is where the "h" in hedge comes from; it takes a
hybrid approach. While a small core is written in C++ for speed, all
user-visible functionality is driven from Python.
