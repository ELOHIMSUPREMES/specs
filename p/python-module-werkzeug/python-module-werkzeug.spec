%description
Werkzeug started as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI
applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility
modules. It includes a powerful debugger, fully featured request and
response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control
headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL
routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules.

It does Unicode and doesn't enforce a specific template engine, database
adapter or anything else. It doesn't even enforce a specific way of
handling requests and leaves all that up to the developer.
