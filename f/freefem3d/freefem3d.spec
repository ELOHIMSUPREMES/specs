%description
ff3d, as well as its cousins, is a PDE solver driven by a user-friendly
language. It solves many kind of problems such as elasticity, fluids
(Stokes and Navier-Stokes) and a lot more. The user has to enter the
equation associated with the problem, giving either the PDE in strong
formulation or weak (variational) formulation.

ff3d can use either the Finite Elements method (the mesh of the geometry
being provided by the user) or a Fictitious Domain like approach where
the geometry is described using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). This
description is done using the POV-Ray language but others such as VRML
could be added.

The processing of the results is left to the user. One can use various
graphic tools: output in the MEdit mesh format or VTK are supported. The
implementation of a Qt-VTK based GUI module is underway.
