%description
Neko is an intermediate programming language. It has been designed to
provide a common runtime for several different languages. Learning and
using Neko is very easy, but you're not supposed to directly program in
Neko. Instead, you can write a generator from your preferred language to
Neko and then use the Neko runtime to compile, run, and access libraries.

Neko is a good way for language designers to focus on design and reuse a
fast and well-designed runtime, as well as existing libraries for
 accessing filesystem, network, databases, xml...
