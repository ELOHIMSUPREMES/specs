%description
OBOE (Oracle Based Optimization Engine) is an open source software for
general convex optimization. It assumes that a user-made code,
thereafter named oracle, is capable of delivering first order
information on the key elements of the problem (support the feasible
set, support to the objective function). The engine exploits this
information to construct the so-called localization set which is a
polyhedral approximation of the set of optimal solutions.
