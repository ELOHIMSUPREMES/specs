%description
BiCePS is one of the libraries that make up the CHiPPS (COIN High
Performance Parallel Search Framework) library hierarchy. It implements
that data-handling functions needed to support development of many types
of relaxation-based branch-and-bound algorithms, especially for solving
mathematical programs. It is intended to capture the implementation of
methods common to all such algorithms without assuming anything about
the structure of the mathematical program or the bounding method used.
