%description
CSDP is a library of routines that implements a predictor corrector
variant of the semidefinite programming algorithm of Helmberg, Rendl,
Vanderbei, and Wolkowicz. The main advantages of this code are that it
is written to be used as a callable subroutine, it is written in C for
efficiency, the code runs in parallel on shared memory multi-processor
systems, and it makes effective use of sparsity in the constraint
matrices.
