%description
CLP is a high quality open-source LP solver. Its main strengths are its
Dual and Primal Simplex algorithms. It also has a barrier algorithm for
Linear and Quadratic objectives. There are limited facilities for
Nonlinear and Quadratic objectives using the Simplex algorithm. It is
available as a library and as a standalone solver. It was written by
John Forrest, jjforre at us.ibm.com.
