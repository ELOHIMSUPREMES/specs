%description
Hermes is a C++ library for rapid development of adaptive hp-FEM / hp-DG
solvers. Novel hp-adaptivity algorithms are designed to solve a large
variety of problems ranging from ODE and stationary linear PDE to
complex time-dependent nonlinear multiphysics PDE systems. The library
comes with a free interactive Online Laboratory where users can run
their models remotely. Detailed user documentation enhanced with many
benchmarks and examples allow the users to employ Hermes without being
experts in object-oriented programming, finite element methods, or in
the theory of partial differential equations. There is an active user
community where users get their questions answered quickly.
