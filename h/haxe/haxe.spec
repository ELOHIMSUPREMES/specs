%description
Haxe (pronounced as hex) is an open source programming language.

While most other languages are bound to their own platform
(Java to the JVM, C# to .Net, ActionScript to the Flash Player),
Haxe is a multiplatform language.

The idea behind Haxe is to let the developer choose the best platform
for a given job. In general, this is not easy to do,
because every new platform comes with its own programming language.

What Haxe provides you with is:
* a standardized language with many good features
* a standard library (including Date, Xml, Math...) that works the same on all platforms
* platform-specific libraries : the full APIs for a given platform are accessible from Haxe
