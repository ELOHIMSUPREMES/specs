%description
%Name (pronounced KLEKS) is a file manager with a full-screen user
interface. It displays directory contents including the file status
details and provides features like command history, filename insertion,
or name completion in order to help users to create commands to be
executed by the shell.
%Name is a versatile tool for system administrators and all users that
utilize the enormous power of the command line. Its unique one-panel
user interface enhances productivity and lessens the probability of
mistake. There are no built-in commands, %Name is an add-on to your
favorite shell.
