%description
CINT is an interpreter for C and C++ code. It is useful e.g. for situations
where rapid development is more important than execution time. Using an
interpreter the compile and link cycle is dramatically reduced facilitating
rapid development. CINT makes C/C++ programming enjoyable even for part-time
programmers.

CINT covers most of ANSI C and ISO C++. A CINT script can call compiled
classes/functions and compiled code can make callbacks to CINT interpreted
functions. Utilities like makecint and rootcint automate the process of
embedding compiled C/C++ library code as shared objects (as Dynamic Link
Library, DLL, or shared library, .so). Source files and shared objects can be
dynamically loaded/unloaded without stopping the CINT process. CINT offers a gdb
like debugging environment for interpreted programs.
