%description
Cube, which is used as performance report explorer for Scalasca and
Score-P, is a generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional
performance space consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric,
(ii) call path, and (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be
represented as a tree, where non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed
or expanded to achieve the desired level of granularity. In addition,
Cube can display multi-dimensional Cartesian process topologies.

The Cube 4.x series report explorer and the associated Cube4 data format
is provided for Cube files produced with the Score-P performance
instrumentation and measurement infrastructure or the Scalasca version
2.x trace analyzer (and other compatible tools). However, for backwards
compatibility, Cube 4.x can also read and display Cube 3.x data.
