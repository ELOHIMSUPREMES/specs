%description
This plugin allows saving outgoing addresses to a designated folder
in the address book. Addresses are saved only if not found in the
address book to avoid unwanted duplicates.
Selecting which headers are scanned for keeping addresses is also
supported (Any or several of 'To', 'Cc' or 'Bcc').
