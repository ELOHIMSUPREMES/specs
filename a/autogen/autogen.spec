%description
AutoGen is a tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text. It is especially valuable in programs that have several blocks of text that must be kept synchronized.

AutoGen can now accept XML files as definition input, in addition to CGI data (for producing dynamic HTML) and traditional AutoGen definitions.

A common example where this would be useful is in creating and maintaining the code required for processing program options. Processing options requires multiple constructs to be maintained in parallel in different places in your program. Options maintenance needs to be done countless times. So, AutoGen comes with an add-on package named AutoOpts that simplifies the maintenance and documentation of program options.

%description -n libopts
AutoOpts is a very powerful command line option parser consisting of a set of AutoGen templates and a run time library that nearly eliminates the hassle of parsing and documenting command line options. This package allows you to specify several program attributes, up to 100 option types and many attributes for each option.

AutoOpts is a very powerful command line option parser consisting of a set
of AutoGen templates and a run time library that nearly eliminates the
hassle of parsing and documenting command line options. This package allows
you to specify several program attributes, up to 100 option types and many
attributes for each option.

This package is needed to write programs that use AutoOpts API.
