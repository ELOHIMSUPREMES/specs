%description
Deepsolver is a package manipulation tool for GNU/Linux system. It
basically designed for ALT Linux RPM environment but in hope it can be
useful for other distributions or even for other package managers.

Main design goals include flexibility, reliability and small execution
time. The core system for package dependency processing is based on
robust 2-SAT algorithm. The tool aims to be a useful instrument both for
users and system administrators. It also includes features to be
appropriate for ALT Linux package building environment.
