%description
0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a
historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive or
rewrite the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years
between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving
state-of-the-art 3D graphics, detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible
and powerful custom-built game engine.

The game has been in development by Wildfire Games (WFG), a group of
volunteer, hobbyist game developers, since 2001. The code and data are
available under the GPL license, and the art, sound and documentation
are available under CC-BY-SA. In short, we consider 0 A.D. an an
educational celebration of game development and ancient history.
