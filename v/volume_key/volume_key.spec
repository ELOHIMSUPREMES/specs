%description
This package provides a command-line tool for manipulating storage volume
encryption keys and storing them separately from volumes.

The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted
hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key
back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software
failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the
company data after an employee leaves abruptly.

%description -n python-module-%name
This package provides Python bindings for libvolume_key, a library for
manipulating storage volume encryption keys and storing them separately from
volumes.

The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted
hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key
back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software
failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the
company data after an employee leaves abruptly.

volume_key currently supports only the LUKS volume encryption format.  Support
for other formats is possible, some formats are planned for future releases.
